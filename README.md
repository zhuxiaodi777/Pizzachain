# Pizzachain


Pizza Chain:
You are developing a software system to manage a Pizza Chain. The chain has several stores in different states and cities. Each store has its own management that can choose items to include and exclude from the pre-defined menu. Each store has its own working hours and rules for delivery. Each store must manage its own accounting of costs and revenue. Store employees include branch managers, and drivers, among others. The software you are developing must also manage these employees, track their salaries, and manage their time schedule.
 
Orders can be sent through a web portal, phone, or text messages. Orders include detailed information, such as items, personal information and contact information, as well as the delivery location. When an order is placed, it is received at the nearest branch for processing. Once processing is complete the pizza will be prepared as per the order instructions. Orders are either eat-in, carry-out, or delivery. Each class of orders requires different steps for completion.
 
Once an order is complete, customers can choose to submit their contact information and/or provide feedback for the branch. All feedback is collectively analyzed to monitor and enhance performance. The software you are developing should manage all aforementioned operations and provide managers with real-time dashboards. Ideally, the software will incorporate some flexibility to fit the small variations for each branch.
